Python Converter of ISO Dates into, and from, French Republican Calendar

The French Republican calendar (French: calendrier républicain français), also commonly called the French Revolutionary calendar (calendrier révolutionnaire français), was a calendar created and implemented during the French Revolution, and used by the French government for about 12 years from late 1793 to 1805, and for 18 days by the Paris Commune in 1871. The revolutionary system was designed in part to remove all religious and royalist influences from the calendar, and was part of a larger attempt at decimalisation in France (which also included decimal time of day, decimalisation of currency, and metrication). It was used in government records in France and other areas under French rule, including Belgium, Luxembourg, and parts of the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Malta, and Italy.

##Month Names:
The Republican calendar year began the day the autumnal equinox occurred in Paris, and had twelve months of 30 days each, which were given new names based on nature, principally having to do with the prevailing weather in and around Paris. The extra five or six days in the year were not given a month designation, but considered Sansculottides or Complementary Days.

+ **Autumn**:
    - Vendémiaire (from French vendange, derived from Latin vindemia, "grape harvest"), starting 22, 23, or 24 September
    - Brumaire (from French brume, "mist"), starting 22, 23, or 24 October
    - Frimaire (From French frimas, "frost"), starting 21, 22, or 23 November
+ **Winter**:
    - Nivôse (from Latin nivosus, "snowy"), starting 21, 22, or 23 December
    - Pluviôse (from French pluvieux, derived from Latin pluvius, "rainy"), starting 20, 21, or 22 January
    - Ventôse (from French venteux, derived from Latin ventosus, "windy"), starting 19, 20, or 21 February
+ **Spring**:
    - Germinal (from French germination), starting 20 or 21 March
    - Floréal (from French fleur, derived from Latin flos, "flower"), starting 20 or 21 April
    - Prairial (from French prairie, "meadow"), starting 20 or 21 May
+ **Summer**:
    - Messidor (from Latin messis, "harvest"), starting 19 or 20 June
    - Thermidor (or Fervidor^[1]) (from Greek thermon, "summer heat"), starting 19 or 20 July
    - Fructidor (from Latin fructus, "fruit"), starting 18 or 19 August

[1] Note: On many printed calendars of Year II (1793–94), the month of Thermidor was named Fervidor (from Latin fervidus, "burning hot").

Most of the month names were new words coined from French, Latin, or Greek. The endings of the names are grouped by season. "Dor" means "giving" in Greek.[9]

##Ten days of the week
The month is divided into three décades or "weeks" of ten days each, named simply:

- primidi (first day)
- duodi (second day)
- tridi (third day)
- quartidi (fourth day)
- quintidi (fifth day)
- sextidi (sixth day)
- septidi (seventh day)
- octidi (eighth day)
- nonidi (ninth day)
- décadi (tenth day)

Décades were abandoned in Floréal an X (April 1802).

##Complementary days
Main article: Sansculottides
Five extra days – six in leap years – were national holidays at the end of every year. These were originally known as les sans-culottides (after sans-culottes), but after year III (1795) as les jours complémentaires:

- 1st complementary day: ***La Fête de la Vertu***, "Celebration of Virtue", on 17 or 18 September
- 2nd complementary day: ***La Fête du Génie***, "Celebration of Talent", on 18 or 19 September
- 3rd complementary day: ***La Fête du Travail***, "Celebration of Labour", on 19 or 20 September
- 4th complementary day: ***La Fête de l'Opinion***, "Celebration of Convictions", on 20 or 21 September
- 5th complementary day: ***La Fête des Récompenses***, "Celebration of Honors (Awards)", on 21 or 22 September
- 6th complementary day: ***La Fête de la Révolution***, "Celebration of the Revolution", on 22 or 23 September (on leap years only)

##Converting from the Gregorian Calendar

The calendar was abolished in the year XIV (1805). After this date, opinions seem to differ on the method by which the leap years would have been determined if the calendar were still in force. There are at least four hypotheses used to convert dates from the Gregorian calendar:

+ **Equinox**: The leap years would continue to vary in order to ensure that each year the autumnal equinox in Paris falls on 1 Vendémiaire, as was the case from year I to year XIV. This is the only method that was ever in legal effect, although it means that sometimes five years pass between leap years, such as the years 15 and 20.[16]

+ **Romme**: Leap years would have fallen on each year divisible by four (thus in 20, 24, 28...), except most century years, according to Romme's proposed fixed rules. This would have simplified conversions between the Republican and Gregorian calendars since the Republican leap day would usually follow a few months after 29 February, at the end of each year divisible by four, so that the date of the Republican New Year remains the same (22 September) in the Gregorian calendar for the entire third century of the Republican Era (AD 1992–2091).[17]

+ **Continuous**: The leap years would have continued in a fixed rule every four years from the last one (thus years 15, 19, 23, 27...) with the leap day added before, rather than after, each year divisible by four, except most century years. This rule has the advantage that it is both simple to calculate and is continuous with every year in which the calendar was in official use during the First Republic. Some concordances were printed in France, after the Republican Calendar was abandoned, using this rule to determine dates for long-term contracts.[18][19]

+ **128-Year**: Beginning with year 20, years divisible by four would be leap years, except for years divisible by 128. Note that this rule was first proposed by von Mädler, and not until the late 19th century. The date of the Republican New Year remains the same (23 September) in the Gregorian calendar every year from 129 to 256 (AD 1920–2047).[20][21][22]

The following table shows when several years of the Republican Era begin on the Gregorian calendar, according to each of the four above methods:
